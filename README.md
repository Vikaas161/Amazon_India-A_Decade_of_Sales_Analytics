Amazon India: A Decade of Sales Analytics-
I built an end-to-end analytics platform using ten years of Amazon India sales data to show how a major e-commerce business actually runs. I started with a massive, 'messy' dataset where one out of every four entries had errors—things like broken dates, weird currency symbols, duplicate orders, handling outliers. I spent a lot of time cleaning this up using Python and storing it in a professional SQL database so it was organized and reliable. From there, I created a series of interactive dashboards and analyzed things like how UPI changed the way Indians pay, why customers return products, and which shoppers are most likely to stop buying.
